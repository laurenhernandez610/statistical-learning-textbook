    "We want outputs from 0 and 1. To model this we usually use the **sigmoid** function $$g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ where $0 < g(z) < 1$. How can we use this to build up to the logistic regression algorithm? Well remember we have the following: $$f_{\\vec{w}, b}(\\vec{x}) = \\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b$$ well what if we replaced the $f(x)$ with a $z$. Then we would have that $$z = \\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b \\to z \\to g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ Then we will get a value between 0 and 1 since we have updated our model to fit logistic regression. Thus, our model gets updated to be known as the **logistic regression model**: $$f_{\\vec{w}, b}(\\vec{x}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b)}}$$ The way you can interpret the result of this function is that what is the probability that the class is 1 given inputs. It will always be given in a decimal from $0 \\to 1$. The probability way to look at it is $$P(y = 0) + P(y = 1) = 1$$ $$f_{\\vec{w}, b}(\\vec{x}) = P(y = 1|\\vec{x}; \\vec{w}, b)$$ The bottom one reads as the following, $f$ of $x$ is equal to probability that $y$ is equal to 1 given the input features $x$ with the parameters $w, b$. The semi-colon seperates the inputs and the parameters that are given to the model. \n",
